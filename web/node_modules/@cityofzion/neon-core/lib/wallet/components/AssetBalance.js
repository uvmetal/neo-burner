 * Balance of an UTXO asset.
 * We keep track of 3 states: unspent, spent and unconfirmed.
 * Unspent coins are ready to be constructed into transactions.
 * Spent coins have been used once in confirmed transactions and cannot be used anymore. They are kept here for tracking purposes.
 * Unconfirmed coins have been used in transactions but are not confirmed yet. This is a holding state until we confirm that the transactions are mined into blocks.
